# Info Panel

RaspberryPI based display panel (LED matrix) API to display stuff like stock prices and other "useful" stuff

# Making it run
`config.json.fill` has to be renamed to `config.json` and API keys should be filled in same as symbols to display.

## What needs to be setup
SSH enabled for easier access
Libcurl - `apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev`
